# Given a number n, and a number of trials t, this program looks for the set of n points on the 3-sphere (glome) whose maximum cosine similarity is minimized among all t of the trials, that is, the set of such points which is as pairwise distant as possible, or equivalently, the set of n vectors whose minimum angle separation is still as close as possible to 90* (for n >= 2*dimension).
# https://mathoverflow.net/questions/24864/almost-orthogonal-vectors
# It does this by:
# 1. Naively randomly (distribution = N(0,1)) generating a 4-tuple of coordinates and then normalizing the result. This gives us a single uniformly random point from the glome.
# 2. Doing step 1 another n-1 times. This gives us a set of n points scattered over the glome.
# 3. Pairwise checking the cosine similarity of points from the set of n points, checking whether this is a new best, and storing it if so. At the end of the t trial runs, this gives us a number - the maximum pairwise dot-product of any two of the vectors/points we generated - and the set of coordinates of the points.
