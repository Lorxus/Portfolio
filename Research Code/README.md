I often write code for research purposes. Some of the best of it is here, and more quality code I've written is in the links below to other repositories, to avoid duplication. 

Much of the code that would go here is in another repo - please have a look at these repositories for more:
- https://github.com/Lorxus/Kepler-Clusterer - data analysis on the Kepler Exoplanet Survey
- https://github.com/Lorxus/HighD-Benchmark-Clusterer - testing out clusterer agreement for high-dimensional artificial datasets
