I wrote code for research purposes. Some of it is here, and more of it is in the links below to other repositories, to avoid duplicating code. 

Much of the code that would go here is duplicated elsewhere - please have a look at these repositories for more:
- https://github.com/Lorxus/Kepler-Clusterer - data analysis on the Kepler Exoplanet Survey
- https://github.com/Lorxus/HighD-Benchmark-Clusterer - testing out clusterer agreement for high-dimensional artificial datasets
